Halloween is coming in a couple of weeks and halloween costume is one of the halloween activities. It is traditionally based on western frightening supernatural or folkloric beings. 

Therefore, we want to take this opportunity to introduce another culture of ghosts and monsters to give people variety of selections to their costumes.

Since all the creatures in Classic of Mountains and Seas are created from peopleâ€™s imaginations.

We want to not only introduce the culture of Chinese monsters, but also let users using their imaginations to create their own monsters by piecing together elements of each origin monster.
